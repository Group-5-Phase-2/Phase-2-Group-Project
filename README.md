# Phase 2 E-Commerce Project

## Description

In this project, we developed an E-Commerce App where a user can register on our platform, view products in our catalogue, add an item on their cart and proceed to checkout, where we implemented a simulated checkout to enable the user perform an easy checkout. Upon checking out, the user receives a receipt to confirm their order and a table displaying the items and total amount.
